# Arenero

The Interactive Sandbox proyect uses infrared data and a projector to create representations of different terrains at runtime.

The Interactive Sandbox project was made on C# on the Unity Game Engine and it's purpose is to help the user understand how terrains 
are created and how this translates to heights andtopographic maps. 
It's posible to change the visual representation projected on the sand, from a realistic take to a representation similar to a height map, 
this by the use of 2 push buttons.

This project was inspired by UC Davis' W.M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in the Earth Sciences (KeckCAVES),
amazing Augmented Reality Sandbox. 
The idea was to create a similar proyect to 'Augmented Reality Sandbox', but developed under a Game Engine
